# 🍃✨ Studio Ghibli Data Quest 🎮🌸

Welcome to my very first Data Science repository! I am currently a Software Design student with a big passion for Data Science and cute aesthetics, and this is my very first project.

## 🗺️ About This Project

This repository explores the magical world of Studio Ghibli through data. Using the [Studio Ghibli Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shruthiiiee/studio-ghibli-dataset), I am analyzing movie success, critical reception, and movie runtimes to find hidden patterns in these cinematic masterpieces.

## 📜 Quest Log (Analysis Goals)

Throughout this project, I am trying to unlock the answers to these questions:
* **Quest 1:** Does the runtime of a Ghibli movie affect its Rotten Tomatoes score?
* **Quest 2:** Which director is the "Boss"?
* **Quest 3:** Are older Ghibli movies rated higher than newer ones?
