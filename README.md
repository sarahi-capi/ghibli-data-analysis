## About This Project 🗺️

This repository explores the magical world of Studio Ghibli through data. Using the [Studio Ghibli Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shruthiiiee/studio-ghibli-dataset), I am analyzing movie success, critical reception, and movie runtimes to find hidden patterns in these cinematic masterpieces.
